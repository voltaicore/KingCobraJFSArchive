    This repo is a clone of https://github.com/ihsoyCT/ctarchive that has been stripped down to only query the KingCobraJFS subreddit. It is still possible to query other subreddits by adjusting the subreddit in the URL.
<p>
<b><br>How To Use: </br></b>
Submit a query using the search fields and dropdown menu filters and press 'Submit Query'. Query results will be listed below the query field. Leaving the search fields empty will either return highest or lowest values based on the dropdown menu selections.
<br></br>
<b>Comments/Submissions:</b>
This will filter either posts made to the subreddit or a comments within the posts on the subreddit. If 'Submissions' is selected the comments to the submission results will be shown under each post as a hyperlinked numerical value of comments the post had received (0 Comments, 1 Comments, etc.).
<br></br>
<b>Sort Type:</b>
The 'Sort Type' dropdown filters by Time, Score, or Comments. Depending on the 'Order' dropdown selection that follows this will either return the most recent or earliest results -depending on 'Comments/Submissions' selection-, the most upvoted or downvoted results, or the results with the most comments or fewest.
<br></br>
<b>Order:</b>
Used to order the values discussed in the 'Sort Type' section by highest or lowest. 'asc' is for ascending meaning the largest values will be shown at the top while 'desc' will show the smallest values at the top.
<br></br>
<b>Limit:</b>
This will show limit the amount of results to a specific amount. 100 is the maximum value of results that can be shown for submissions.
<br></br>
<b>After:</b> and <b>Before:</b>
These are time based filters. 'After' is used as the beginning margin for a selection while 'Before' is the end margin. Both date and time entries are required if using this filter. The 'Time' entry is formatted for a twelve hour, AM/PM entry.
<br></br>
<b>Author:</b>
This is the name of the account whom posted the submission or comment.
<br></br>
<b>Score:</b>
'Score' is used for filtering to a select value of votes a post or comment has received. Chances are you will not be using this field often.
<br></br>
<b>Number of Comments:</b>
Used to filter to a specific amount of comments a submission has received.
<br></br>
<b>Search:</b>

<br></br>
<b>Clear:</b>
Clears all search fields and search results. Defaults search fields back to page default.
</p>

If filtering by submissions the comments related to each post will be shown as a hyperlinked numerical value of comments  (0 Comments, 10 Comments, 300 Comments, etc.) above the body of the submission. After clicking the comments of a submission press your browswers back button to return to the list of submission search results.
